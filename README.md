## Dataset Description

This dataset is a valuable resource for those interested in the Melbourne housing market. It can be used to analyze trends in property prices and characteristics, and to gain insights into the factors that influence the Melbourne housing market. This dataset can also be used to develop predictive models to estimate property prices based on property features.

The Melbourne Housing Market dataset contains information about residential properties sold in Melbourne, Australia between 2016 and 2018. 

It includes features such as suburb, address, type of property, number of rooms, price, method of sale, seller, date of sale, distance from central business district (CBD), postcode, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, car spaces, land size, building area, year built, council area, latitude and longitude, region name, and property count.

## Dataset EDA Implications

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) can provide important insights into the supermarket sales dataset. 

By visualizing the data and identifying correlations between variables, researchers can gain a better understanding of consumer behavior. For example, by comparing sales by product line, researchers can identify which products are most popular and which products are underperforming.

- Outliers: The dataset contains some outliers, particularly in the 'Price', 'Distance', 'Landsize', and 'BuildingArea' columns. These outliers may need to be investigated further to determine if they are genuine data points or errors.

- Missing data: The dataset contains some missing data in the 'BuildingArea' and 'YearBuilt' columns. This missing data may need to be imputed or excluded from the analysis.

- Distribution of numerical features: The dataset contains several numerical features, such as 'Price', 'Distance', and 'BuildingArea'. An analysis of the distribution of these features can help identify any patterns or relationships.

- Correlation analysis: A correlation analysis can be performed to identify any strong relationships between features, such as the correlation between 'Price' and 'Rooms'. This can help to identify the most important features for predicting property values.

Finally, by analyzing the relationship between sales and time of day, day of the week, and month of the year, researchers can identify patterns in consumer behavior and optimize marketing strategies accordingly.
## Insights and Predictions from the Dataset
- Average house price: The average house price in Melbourne is around AUD 1 million, with suburbs closer to the city center being more expensive than those farther away.

- Property types: The most common property types in Melbourne are houses and apartments, with houses being more expensive on average.

- Property characteristics: Properties with more rooms, bathrooms, and car spaces tend to be more expensive, with each additional feature adding to the price. Additionally, properties with larger land sizes and building areas tend to be more expensive.

- Geographic trends: Suburbs closer to the city center tend to have higher property prices than those farther away. Additionally, some suburbs, such as Southbank, have experienced rapid price growth in recent years due to their proximity to the city and new developments.

- Prices vary greatly by suburb: The dataset shows that property prices can vary greatly by suburb, even within the same city. This suggests that location is a key factor in determining property values.

- Prices will continue to rise: The Melbourne Housing Market dataset shows that property prices have been steadily rising in recent years. Predictive models can be used to forecast future price increases, which can help buyers and sellers make informed decisions.

- Suburbs undergoing development may see property value increases: As new infrastructure and developments are built in certain suburbs, property values may increase as the demand for housing in those areas grows.

- Sustainability features may increase property value: There is growing interest in sustainability and energy efficiency in the housing market. Properties with features such as solar panels, rainwater harvesting systems, and energy-efficient appliances may command higher prices in the future. Predictive models can be used to estimate the impact of these features on property values.
